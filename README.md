## HW4 - Doodle Jump
### Danny Philbrook & Cooper Nusbaum
 

This is our Doodle Jump project that, over a month timespan, we have collectively spent around 16 hours planning, designing, and testing our assignment. It turned out to be a lengthy assignment, and it got hard to manage sometimes with other assignments being due, but in the end it was a good challenge. 

## Additional Functionalities
Pause button: Pressing the space bar pauses the game, and you can reclick to unpause the game. 

## Issues During Development 

Fixed the game from immediate ending saying game over by adjusting player and platform positions.
Improved logic for detecting the player touching a platform. The player was going through the platforms initially, it took trial and error to get it just right.
Movement was choppy so we created smooth movement by tracking key presses.
