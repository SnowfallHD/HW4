## HW4 - Doodle Jump
### Danny Philbrook & Cooper Nusbaum
 

This is our Doodle Jump project that, over a month timespan, we have collectively spent around 16 hours planning, designing, and testing our assignment. It turned out to be a lengthy assignment, and it got hard to manage sometimes with other assignments being due, but in the end it was a good challenge.
